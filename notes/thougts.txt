Figuring out how to get the LEDs into a "matrix" because there isn't enough gpio on rpi0
Looks like a 4x4 LED matrix would be reasonable.
I think I will need an I2C IC LED extender

Top/Bot Inning: 2
Outs:           3
Balls:          4
Strikes:        3
bases:          3

Total LEDs:     15

Concern here is that I'll need more gpio to power each segment of the display.
If I figure out what to do for this, I can easily use more 7 seg displays for the other items below
I could maybe use a 4 digit 7 segment display (SH5461AS?) for the score. 2 digits for home 2 digits for away
Could use a 2 digit 7 segment display and use a MAX

Inning Number:  single digit 7 seg disp 
Score: 4 digit 7 segment display? Or 2 seperate 2 digit 7 seg displays?
       SH5461AS + MCP23017 for both teams score.


These are wishes for now but might try and throw them on an OLED display and have the info scroll
Got the Screens from the old portable dvd players. Possibly use these? Not sure how they work yet.
