Steps to success

1. Find a website to scrape from that the url doesnt change: mlb.com/indians/scores looks promising
2. Scrape the correct data
3. Get raspi setup with the working script
4. Build breadboard led field and have all the data about the game
    Balls/strikes
    outs
    score
    baserunners
    number of player at bat
    inning top/bottom
5. Connect raspi to the led field and update the field based on the data that was scraped from the website
6. Once everything is working THEN worry about making it nice. KISS
